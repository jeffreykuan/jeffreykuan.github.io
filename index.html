	<p> Welcome! </p>
	
	<p> I am a National Science Foundation Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Maryland, College Park math department. I am interested in partial differential equations, fluid-structure interaction (FSI), kinetic theory, applied mathematics, and applications of probability to PDEs. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics at University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of Professor Sunčica Čanić, and wrote a dissertation titled "Deterministic and stochastic fluid-structure interaction". </p> 
	
	<p> I received an A.B. degree from Princeton University in 2018 in mathematics with a certificate in musical performance (in violin). </p>

	<p> Currently, I am working on studying deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations arising in compressible flow dynamics, kinetic models of flocking, and biology. My work is supported by the National Science Foundation under the MSPRF award <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303177&HistoricalAwards=false">DMS-2303177</a>. </p>
		
	<p> Currently, I am the co-organizer of the Research Interaction Team in Applied PDEs at University of Maryland, College Park. </p>
