	Welcome! <br> <br> 
	I am a fifth year graduate student at the UC Berkeley math department. I am interested in partial differential equations, fluid-structure interaction (FSI), kinetic theory, applied mathematics, and applications of probability to PDEs. I am advised by Professor Suncica Canic. My qualifying exam syllabus can be found <a href="QualSyllabus.pdf">here</a>. 
	
	<br> <br> I received an A.B. degree from Princeton University in 2018 in mathematics with a certificate in musical performance (in violin). 
	
	<br> <br> Currently, I am a GSI for Math 10A, Methods of Mathematics: Calculus, Statistics, and Combinatorics. I received the Outstanding GSI Award in Spring 2019. Below, you can find links to the course materials for the previous classes I have taught. 

	<br> <br> 

	I am also a long-distance runner. I have run distances from 5K, 10K (PR 43:38), to half marathon (PR 1:36:17) and marathon. I also play the violin and guitar, and love music in general.
